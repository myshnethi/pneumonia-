With the high rise in popularity of neural networks, researchers and engineers have been able to find many world-changing applications for computer vision. Today, I want to show you an example of this. By acquiring a labeled dataset of chest x-ray scans for pneumonia, I was able to rapidly build and prototype an artificial intelligence model that identified pneumonia cases with 90% accuracy.
